## My Dog Adventure

**May 30, 2025**

Today something kinda scary but also awesome happened.

After school, I went to visit my neighbor, Mrs. Jones. She has this dog called Max. He’s big, brown, and has these HUGE eyes that stare right into you. I’ve always wanted to pat him, but honestly, I was a little freaked out. What if he bit me? What if he didn’t like me?

Mrs. Jones told me I could try to pat him if I wanted. She said, “Just let him sniff your hand first, sweetie. That’s how dogs say hello.” I nodded like I was brave, but my stomach felt like it was full of jumping beans.

I stuck out my hand super slow. Max looked at it, then leaned in. His nose was cold and wet. He sniffed my hand so carefully, almost like he was reading a secret message. For a second, I thought—what if he snaps? What if I end up with only four fingers? (Okay, maybe that’s dramatic.)

But Max just kept sniffing, then his tail started wagging. He looked up at me with those big eyes, like he was saying, “Hey, you’re cool.” I smiled and reached out to pat his head. His fur was soft, and he closed his eyes, leaning into my hand.

In the end, nothing bad happened. Actually, it was awesome. I think Max liked me, and I definitely like him. Next time, I won’t be so nervous.

**Note to self:** Sometimes things are only scary in your head.
